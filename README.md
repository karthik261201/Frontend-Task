# FrontendTask

## Working
This application allows users to upload images and interact with them in a dynamic way. Key features include:

Image Upload: Users can easily upload images, which will be displayed on the main screen.
Drag and Drop: Uploaded images can be freely moved around the screen using the cursor.
Zoom Functionality: Double-clicking on an image and dragging horizontally enables users to zoom in or out based on the drag direction.
Rotation: Triple-clicking an image allows users to rotate it in any direction, providing flexibility in positioning.
Screen Transfer: Users can transfer images from Screen 1 to Screen 2 seamlessly.
This implementation combines intuitive user interactions with robust functionality, making image manipulation a breeze.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.11.
